Game based on PixiJS library.

The shooter's goal is to stop the enemies from entering to his base. Each bullet costs money but every shooted enemy gives money. If the player is lucky, he will get a golden feather, shooting down this feather will give him a cash bonus. The game uses different PIXI.Container() to change screens, so if the player loses, he will be able to start the game again.
